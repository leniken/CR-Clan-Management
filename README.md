# Clash Royale Clan Management with Discord implementation

## Installation

Download the latest release and extract the file into a local folder.
Rename config_example.php to config.php and adjust the settings.
Upload all files to a webserver with php functionality and configure a (sub)domain to have access to the files. You can also host it locally e.g. with XAMPP.
Access the domain or localhost to use the script.

## Usage

On the webpage you can see the current script suggestions. To post on discord either hit the button, followed by your password or access `<your domain>/cm.php?pw=<your password>`.  The latter can alos be used to setup a [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) task.
Ususually it's best to check the script Sundays, before the stats reset.
